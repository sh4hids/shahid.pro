Hi, I am Shahid from Dhaka, Bangladesh. This is the source code of my personal website. It is based on the theme [gatsby-theme-open-sourcerer](https://github.com/sh4hids/gatsby-theme-open-sourcerer)

## Quick Start

1. Create a site

Use [gatsby-cli](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-0/#gatsby-cli) to bootstrap a new site:

```bash
gatsby new my-site https://github.com/sh4hids/gatsby-starter-open-sourcerer
```

2. Start development server

Navigate to the site directory and start the development server:

```bash
cd my-site
gatsby develop
```

3. See the kit in action

Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser to see your site in action or visit `http://localhost:8000/___graphql` to check the graphql playground.

4. Start hacking

Open the current directory in your favorite code editor and start hacking the kit. All the necessary instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/sh4hids/gatsby-theme-open-sourcerer#readme).

## Available commands

-   `npm start` or `npm run develop` - will run develop server
-   `npm run build` - will create production build
-   `npm run serve` - will run the production build
-   `npm run clean` - will clear cache and other build files
