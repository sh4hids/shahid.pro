            I am a fullstack JavaScript Developer from Dhaka, Bangladesh (ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡©). I
            love to work with Node, React, Astro, Tailwind CSS, SQL/NoSQL, and
            all other related technologies. When I am not coding, I like to read
            books, do gardening and spend time with my family and friends.

            I was born in a small town called Feni in Bangladesh. I grew up and
            completed my early education there. After that, I moved to Dhaka for
            higher education. I completed my Bachelor of Science in Computer
            Science and Engineering from BRAC University.

            I started working part-time during the last year of my graduation
            (in 2017). I worked as UI/UX designer on my first job (which helps
            me build up my basic UI/UX knowledge). Then I worked as a JavaScript
            developer for a short time in e small startup and developed a
            desktop app using Electron.

            I started working full-time after completing my graduation (from
            January 1, 2018). Since then, I have worked for several companies in
            different fields in different positions. So far, I have worked on
            social networking platforms for businesses, freelancing platforms,
            and lead generation tools.

            I have been writing JavaScript for about six and a half years. I
            have written API services with Express, Koa, MongoDB, MySQL, and
            DynamoDB. For client apps, I used React, Redux, After.js, Next.js,
            Gatsby, Styled Components, MaterialUI, etc.

            I like to spend my free time with my family (that's why my future
            goal is to join a fully remote team). My favorite hobby is
            gardening, and I also like to keep pets. I have a rooftop garden.
            Every day I spend some time in the morning and evening in my garden.
