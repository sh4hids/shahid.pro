            I am a full-stack software engineer working remotely from Feni,
            Bangladesh (ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡©). I love to work with JavaScript (TypeScript) and all
            the related technologies. When not programming, I like to read
            books, do gardening, and spend time with my family.

            I was born in a small town called Feni in Bangladesh. I grew up and
            completed my early education there. After that, I moved to Dhaka for
            higher education. I completed my Bachelor of Science in Computer
            Science and Engineering from BRAC University.

            I started working part-time during the last year of my graduation
            (in 2017). I worked as a UI/UX designer on my first job (which helps
            me build up my basic UI/UX knowledge). Then I worked as a JavaScript
            developer for a short time in e small startup and developed a
            desktop app using Electron.

            Next.js, Gatsby, Astro, Styled Components, MaterialUI, Tailwind CSS

            I like to spend my free time with my family (<i
                >that's why I joined a fully remote team</i
            >). My favorite hobby is gardening, and I also like to keep pets. I
            have a rooftop garden. Every day I spend some time in my garden.
