Working with the gatsby.js site and google analytics is a little bit tricky if you consider performance. With the latest lighthouse version (v6 and above), performance reduces a lot if you have Google Tag Manager (especially if you install `gatsby-plugin-google-analytics`). A few months back, I even removed analytics from one of my sites as I was obsessed with performance.

But I didn't want to remove analytics from my newly built site and didn't want to reduce the performance too. So, I started researching for a solution and found a way to delay loading the analytics script [here](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/24332#issuecomment-752373784). I modified the script to match the new gtag script setup. It injects the gtag script after a certain period or if a user starts interacting with the site.

## Setting up gtag

We need to add the following script in our `gatsby-browser.js` file. Here we are using an environment variable to hide our google analytics tracking id. You should add a `.env` file and provide the value for `GATSBY_GA_TRACKING_ID` there. You can adjust the script loading delay in the `onreadystatechange` method (I got the best result for 3500 ms).

```javascript
function initGTM() {
    if (window.isGTMLoaded) {
        return false;
    }

    window.isGTMLoaded = true;

    const script = document.createElement('script');

    script.type = 'text/javascript';
    script.async = true;
    script.src = `https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=${process.env.GATSBY_GA_TRACKING_ID}`;

    script.onload = () => {
        window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
        function gtag() {
            dataLayer.push(arguments);
        }
        gtag('js', new Date());

        gtag('config', `${process.env.GATSBY_GA_TRACKING_ID}`);
    };

    document.head.appendChild(script);
}

function loadGTM(event) {
    initGTM();
    event.currentTarget.removeEventListener(event.type, loadGTM);
}

exports.onClientEntry = () => {
    document.onreadystatechange = () => {
        if (document.readyState !== 'loading') {
            setTimeout(initGTM, 3500);
        }
    };

    document.addEventListener('scroll', loadGTM);
    document.addEventListener('mousemove', loadGTM);
    document.addEventListener('touchstart', loadGTM);
};
```

## Add tracking ID on GitHub Action env

I am using GitHub Action to automate the deployment of my site. So, I have to read the environment variable from the deployment server. We can provide a `.env` file in our project, but this will not be secure. We can use GitHub's project secret to hide our credentials/secrets. Navigate to your project's settings page and go to the `Secrets` page from the menu. Now, add a repository secret named `GATSBY_GA_TRACKING_ID` and provide your tracking id as a value.

In your workflow configuration file add a section called `env`. In the `env` section add the environment variable like shown below. You should keep in mind that, `env` section should come before the `jobs` section in your workflow configuration.

```yaml
name: GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

env:
  GATSBY_GA_TRACKING_ID: ${{secrets.GATSBY_GA_TRACKING_ID}}

jobs:
  deploy:
  ......
  ......
```

## Hard Lesson

> If you want to access the environment variable in the BROWSER in a Gatsby site, prefix your variable name with `GATSBY_`.

Thanks a lot for reading the post, and please share if you find it useful.
